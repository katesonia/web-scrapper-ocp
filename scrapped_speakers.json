I was fascinated by the fact that you could own an actual computer you could program rather than continue to plunk down quarters playing the same old Pac-Man and Space Invaders games. I proceeded to spend many hours not only playing video games on the machine, but also learning to write code just so that I could tinker with them too. I even went so far as to create my own simple video games!  Years later, after graduating from UT Austin with my BSEE, I joined Compaq's Personal Systems Group (PSG) where I focused on hardware design. After spending several years at Compaq, the world changed, and it was bought by HP in the early 2000's. After this merger, I continued throughout the years in various roles at HPE. My most recent role is within the Service Provider Pre-Sales team as a Technologist / Customer Architect.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipleech/\n"
