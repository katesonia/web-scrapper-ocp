Additionally, there are size limitations, with less space between rows of equipment than what is found in typical data centers, requiring smaller enclosures with limited access to the rear of the rack. With these base specifications, Nokia aims to ensure   compatibility of future solutions with current systems, as telecom equipment are typically in service for long cycles.",

Instead of attempting to create benchmarks using real services / mocked up services, we took a completely different approach to measuring microservice “performance” on our hardware. We created a service agnostic performance abstraction, by profiling hundreds of hosts in our fleet using Intels top-down telemetry package. Analyzing this data provided us a clear top-down pattern of which resources within the core pipeline and memory subsystem were heavily used when running our microservices in production. From this data, we then selected a few SPECCPU2017 subcomponent(s) whose top-down profile(s) closely matched the “top down profile” seen in our production fleet. We propose a similar approach can be applied to study the performance of container workloads using CMS memory pooled solution",

Using optical circuit switches (OCSes) and optical transceivers developed in-house, we employ hardware and software codesign to integrate the fabrics into our network and computing infrastructure. Key to our design is a high degree of multiplexing enabled by new kinds of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) and optical circulators that support high-bandwidth bidirectional traffic on a single strand of optical fiber. The development of the requisite OCS and optical transceiver technologies leads to a synchronous lightwave fabric that is reconfigurable, low latency, rate agnostic, and highly available. These fabrics have provided substantial benefits for long-lived traffic patterns in our datacenter networks and predictable traffic patterns in tightly-coupled compute clusters. We report results for a large-scale ML superpod with 4096 tensor processing unit (TPU) chips that has more than one ExaFLOP of computing power. For this use case, the deployment of a lightwave fabric provides up to 3× better system availability and model-dependent performance improvements of up to 3.3× compared to a static fabric, despite constituting less than 6% of the total system cost.",

Our results will demonstrate that a carbon-driven methodology taking into account system-level, rack-level, and data-center-level quantification of detailed carbon footprints, can optimize for scalability, performance, and operational efficiency without compromise.

    "event_detials": "The power consumption of next-generation microprocessors is expected to reach 1000 W, with core logic voltages below 1.0 V and peak current demand beyond 1000 A. With operating currents beyond 1000 A, the high power distribution network (PDN) resistance of the current lateral power delivery (LPD) solution can lead to a dramatic voltage drop and unacceptable power distribution losses, which significantly limits processor performance, reduces system energy efficiency, and hinders data center decarbonization. This work presents a high-performance 48-V-to-1-V switching bus converter to address the above challenges with vertical power delivery (VPD). With the sufficiently high power density enabled by the switching-bus-based architecture, the proposed switching bus converter can be placed underneath the microprocessors, which can significantly reduce the PDN resistance. A hardware prototype was designed, built, and tested up to 1200-A output current and achieved excellent performance.",

They are compatible with multiple PIC platforms, including silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride.  Because they are metallic, they can be used over a large temperature ranges including operation at cryogenic temperatures.  This paper considers the opto-mechanical design of the connectors for vertical coupling using diffractive grating couplers. Low losses are obtained despite misalignment using expanded-beam optical paths.

To enable CXL, we extend CacheLib, a general-purpose caching library from Meta, to support multiple byte-addressable memory tiers. In our design, the first tier is DRAM-backed memory, the second tier is CXL-backed memory, and the last level remains backed by NVM device. Compared to a system without CXL – we improve the throughput by reducing pressure on NVM layer and increase total cache hit ratio with additional CXL memory.

This requires intelligence at every level of the disaggregated memory fabric and relies on techniques like prefetching, caching, and near memory/storage compute to mitigate the high latency to far memory.  The fabric memory controller (ie. FPGA/ASIC) evaluates the needs of the requesting agent, derives the cluster level telemetry, make decisions on the data movement, data placement, replication, compression etc across the entire far memory hierarchy. This is complementary to the OS based techniques focused on movement between near and far memory hierarchies. The ability to extend the far memory tiers to remote nodes can help achieve the benefits of both memory tiering and pooling ie. provide additional capacity and bandwidth, while creating multiple pooled resources available to more than one node.",

The accelerated life testing given Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) standards is relevant just for air cooling but there are no such standards for the reliability evaluation of interconnects in immersion cooling. The present study focuses on the material compatibility of interconnects in a dielectric liquid, exposure tests, material chemical considerations, electrical tests, mechanical tests, and environmental tests. This comprehensive evaluation process aims to identify the physics of failure in connector design. By understanding these factors, improvements can be made to enhance the reliability performance of interconnects and drive the community to make key decisions on material selection, ensuring compatibility and avoiding any risk of failure.",

Intel and Lattice were key contributors to the LTPI part of DC-SCM2.0 specification and worked together to secure features in the LTPI spec which allow interoperability between different CPLD/FPGA vendors. Intel and Lattice joined forces to prove the interoperability features in practice by successfully integrating Intel and Lattice LTPI implementations and proved spec interoperability features. In the DC-MHS Experience Center we will show the LTPI interoperability demo between Intel MAX10 and Lattice MachXO3 CPLDs and LTPI IPs. The demo showcases the possibility to mix and match LTPI solutions from two major FPGA vendors. Axiado along with AMD and Tyan bring in an innovative DC-SCM demo powered by its TCU (Trusted Control/Compute Unit) that combines most of the DC-SCM components into a single chip SOC solution. In this demo, Axiado's DC-SCM2.0 card, plugged into AMD-powered Tyan HPM, showcases open-source Root-of-trust IP Caliptra based trust services. This DC-SCM2.0 card is unique in being the first 1U vertical form factor card and Axiado is contributing the design into the OCP community.",

We propose a simplified source routing framework enabled by SAI that predetermines flow paths, and programs them across access nodes in an AI fabric, taking advantage of AI training flow predictability.In the proposed framework, software controllers engineer traffic flows between training elements, optimizing for bandwidth utilization, load, and latency. Using such an approach reduces network cost and power requirements as compared to fabric scheduling. ",

At the beginning, it was perceived that, without a 30 DWPD spec, enterprise cannot think of adopting this new breed of storage units, purchase specs also continued to show very high concurrency max IOPS specs as a minimum requirement. Vendors have normalized these specs which became “industry standard”. But are we really over-burdening these SSDs? With higher number of die and/or storage units come the challenge of maintence cost and disposal cost. It is now the time to rethink about the swimlanes of standard and medium endurance and see whether there is room to improve on how we segmentize a vast landscape of cloud and enterprise storage. Session will look into the design criteria to achieve performance and endurance level that has the right impact for real life use case for specific applications and how designing for them generates better sustainability for future. ",

They allow administrators to remotely monitor and manage thousands of servers within cloud data centers. By necessity, BMCs have access to critical server functions, such as installing operating systems and monitoring and controlling cooling fans, power supplies, and operating temperatures. Compromising a BMC, therefore, can lead to a compromised server. Vulnerabilities can remain undetected and uncorrected for years, as was discovered in the “Pantsdown” exposure in 2019. Remote access to BMCs makes them attractive targets to orchestrate attacks at scale. Correspondingly, cloud data centers operate at scale. Therefore, securing the BMC on cloud servers is important to prevent unauthorized access, maintain system integrity and availability, protect against attacks, meet compliance requirements, and enable effective remote server management. The Open Compute Project (OCP) Security Workgroup has identified security of the BMC as a key focus area. This work specifically targets three of OCP’s core tenets:  Impact, Openness, and Scalability and suggests guidelines for securing these vital system components.",

To help datacenter chipmakers add an RoT to devices, OCP started the open-source project Caliptra, which defines core RoT capabilities that must be implemented in any device in a cloud platform. The core of Caliptra’s attestation mechanism is based on a Unique Device Secret. This talk explains how SRAM based Physical Unclonable Functions (or PUFs) provide these root secrets in the most secure and flexible way. PUFs extract unique silicon properties or “silicon fingerprints” from chips to validate authenticity of each individual chip and to extract cryptographic keys. PUFs increase system security since the keys they create are never stored in non-volatile memory. Furthermore, they add flexibility because PUFs don’t require key provisioning or on-chip non-volatile memory. ",

    "event_detials": " TCCO (total carbon cost of ownership) is a critical measure as the industry tackles the global data explosion.  It will take storage innovation and renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality.  New storage technologies like HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording) promise an increase in HDD capacities to 32TB, 40TB and beyond.  The carbon impact of  a 50TB drive will be approximately same as a 2 TB drive.  Many enterprises and cloud providers are capped a lower capacities today.SSDs have larger embedded carbon due to energy intensive semiconductor manufacturing and both SSDs and HDDs consume energy during the use phase.  Finally, hundreds of millions of SSD and HDD drives are retired each year and most are destroyed yet most have usable life left. Drive sanitization and reuse has carbon emission savings and helps achieve zero waste goals.",
